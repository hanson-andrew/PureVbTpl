PureVbTpl
=========

A VB.Net implementation of the TPL based purely in .NET 3.5.

Why Would You Do This?!?
------------------------
I had a project to do that required VisualBasic.NET and .NET 3.5, but I had ample time to complete the project. I had spent way too long already working with the good old `BackgroundWorker` class and really wanted to make the jump up to using the TPL that was a part of .NET 4.0. 

What Should I Do With This?
---------------------------
I would recommend absolutely nothing. This is here as a memoriam to work I've done. There are some projects I have that are still VB.NET and 3.5 so I might use it on those. If you are in the same predicament and want to give it a try feel free. It works for me, but I'm sure there are some things wrong with it here or there. Feel free to contribute bug fixes if you wish.
